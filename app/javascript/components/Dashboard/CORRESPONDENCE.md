Carson,

I appreciate your assistance in this.  I have implemented 3 of the features we discussed. Two I have finished the UI and Business logic and one only the Business Logic.

1. Multiple State Selection
2. Two year comparison via the Periods drop down menu
3. Zoom on the line chart, this changes the range like we discussed

Features of note
2. Changing the state updates the US Map
3. Changing the date I still am not clear on what we want since I added zoom... your help would be appreciated.
4. Themable
5. Mobile aware, and somewhat usable on a my iPhone

I have attached a number of screenshots, and please know this is in rough draft. I still have UI/UX elements to add. For instance:
* Legend ???
* Tooltip for the dots
* x-Axis rotate to 45deg
* y-axis ????
* periods selector bug
* Styling the US Map
* Determine wording for Multi-Year comparisons

I started taking these screenshots and putting my thoughts together an hour ago, and just noticed the time.

Ooof, It was my goal to get this email to you by 2pm so we could do an iteration, and it's 5pm and you're off work.  As you can see, I still have about 4-5 hours of work on this, and I was wondering because of my lateness, am I still under consideration for the role?

Kind and thankful regards,
Lenny Miller
ps
Do you have a larger range of data so I can work with a full year of comparisons?

Carson,

I forgot to include the mobile view, not sure if you want mobile, so I added the basic support.

Hi Lenny,

This is looking good! Some quick notes:
The date filter should have two elements: start date, and end date. This will define the range of data points to filter the line graph. For example, "January 1st - June 1st" would filter the dataset and visualize it with the X-axis reflecting range "January 1st - June 1st".
It would be good to add labeling for the Y-axis to convey the number of trips taken.
The mobile optimization is a nice extra touch, but is not needed for this assignment.
I appreciate you sharing your notes, and next steps. Yes, that sounds alright to put a few more hours into it to wrap things up.

Once I get your code I'll run it locally, and evaluate it with the team. From there, we'll look to schedule our second interview call.

Have a great weekend Lenny! And I look forward to hearing from you.

Carson
